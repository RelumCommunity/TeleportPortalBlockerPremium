Hi, the code for now won't be public, so don't ask for it please.

If you want to try some of the features of our plugin you can test the free version here (should work also in the new mc versions): https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/teleport-portal-blocker-free-1-7-2-1-19-3.70785/

If you encounter any kind of problem you can create a new issue, please try to say every little thing you remember about the issue including some screenshots.

Thanks for your support.
